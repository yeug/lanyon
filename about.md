Hi. I am Eugene.

I’m an entrepreneur exploring ways to foster a healthy public sphere.

I co-founded [Cortico](https://cortico.ai) from the [Laboratory for Social Machines](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/social-machines/overview/) at the MIT Media Lab.

I care about community-powered understanding. The country is more polarized than ever. The media dehumanized. The people divided. The politics painted red and blue. I'm interested in designing and creating new civic spaces for local voices to be heard in civil, empathic public conversation that heals divisions from the inside of communities out. By feeding diverse, community voices back into the public, we can inspire narratives and action that build bridges.

Some other organizations I have involved with:
